                                    <p>Welcome superheroes and Arrowmen of Section C-4A! I am thoroughly excited to have
                                        the opportunity to ensure a spectacular Conclave for the Arrowmen of this
                                        section. In fact, I am excited for all the Arrowmen that will attend this
                                        weekend of training, fun, and fellowship! The Order of the Arrow is an
                                        organization based on tradition, with over one hundred years of tradition.
                                        Conclave within Section C-4A has a tradition of excellence, and the CVCs and
                                        Coordinators plan on continuing that tradition this year. Working hand-in-hand
                                        with the service lodge, Marnoc, we will ensure a successful conclave for this
                                        last configuration of the six lodges. We have had a great run of conclaves over
                                        the years, but we all know it is not over yet. We need to go out with a bang,
                                        and that is exactly what we intend to do with our superheroes at Camp Manatoc.
                                        It may even include a “Pow” and a “Bam.” What this event will really come down
                                        to, though, is the participants. I know our Council of Chiefs members will do
                                        everything in their power to make this conclave the best it can be, but we can’t
                                        provide the costumes, the electricity, and the enthusiasm from the crowd at the
                                        shows. We will provide the atmosphere, but it is the fantastic Arrowmen
                                        attending this Conclave that will truly make it the best it can be.</p>
